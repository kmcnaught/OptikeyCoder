# OptiKey Coder

This is an experimental fork of [OptiKey](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey) with some features and ideas specific to users who want to write code. 

There is a low bar to adding features/hacks in the interest of trialling different workflows and seeing what is most helpful. However, the stability this fork is not guaranteed - if you like a feature, open an issue to discuss whether it's appropriate for going back into the core Optikey app.
